    <h1>Lasagna recipe</h1>
    <img src="../pictures/lasagna.jpeg" alt="A picture of lasagna on a plate"/>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
         made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
         A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but
          my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
          I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
